I'm so sorry to worry you, but I wanted to let you know as soon as possible. 
I'm really hoping it's nothing serious, but I'll know more soon."
I'm trying to stay calm, but it's hard. I just want to get better and get back to you."
I know you're probably worried about me, too. But I want you to know that I'm in good hands. 
The doctors and nurses here are amazing. And I have you in my corner, too. That means the world to me."
"I love you so much. Please don't worry about me. I'm going to be okay."
I'll be thinking of you every minute. 
And I'll be counting down the days until I can see you again.
